# Module Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment Variables Cleanup
- **`.env.local`**: Removed unused collection references (events, sheets, notes, calls)
- **`.env`**: Streamlined to include only essential collections (users, leads, properties, projects)
- **`.env.example`**: Cleaned up to match production configuration

### 2. MCP Server Cleanup
- **`mcp-server/src/index.js`**: 
  - Removed events from analytics schema (now supports: leads, properties, overview)
  - Cleaned up validation schemas
  - Fixed corrupted file and recreated with proper structure
- **`mcp-server/src/appwrite-service.js`**: 
  - Removed events and sheets from collections configuration
  - Removed `getEventsAnalytics()` method
  - Updated `getOverviewAnalytics()` to exclude events data
  - Cleaned up analytics switch statements

### 3. Utility Files Cleanup
- **`src/utils/diagnostics.js`**: 
  - Fixed `databases.list()` error by replacing with proper Query-based approach
  - Removed events collection references
  - Added comment explaining module removal
- **`src/utils/enhancedDataFetch.js`**: 
  - Removed events collection from CONFIG
  - Updated testAllCollections to exclude events

### 4. Action Files Cleanup
- **`src/actions/event.js`**: Completely removed (✅)

### 5. Build Verification
- Project builds successfully with no errors (✅)
- All TypeScript checks pass (✅)
- No broken imports or references (✅)

## Remaining Core Collections
The application now focuses on these essential collections:
- **Users**: User management and authentication
- **Leads**: Lead tracking and management  
- **Properties**: Property/unit management
- **Projects**: Project organization

## Database Connection Status
- ✅ Connected to Appwrite Cloud (https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1)
- ✅ Project ID: 6732766d002b223d1598
- ✅ Database ID: 677a9e5c0014e2994c62
- ✅ Properties filter issue resolved (was hiding 3,228 records)
- ✅ MCP server operational for AI system integration

## Key Fixes Applied
1. **Properties Data Access**: Removed `Query.notEqual("activity", "primary")` filter that was excluding all property records
2. **Diagnostics Connection**: Fixed `databases.list()` error with proper Query usage
3. **Module References**: Systematically removed all references to deprecated modules
4. **Environment Consistency**: Aligned all environment files with current collection structure

## Performance Impact
- Reduced bundle size by removing unused modules
- Cleaner codebase with fewer dependencies
- Streamlined database queries
- Improved build performance

The application is now cleaned up and optimized, focusing only on the core functionality needed for the CRM system.
