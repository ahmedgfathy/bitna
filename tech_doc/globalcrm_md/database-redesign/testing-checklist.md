### ✅ Data Completeness
```sql
-- Test queries to verify data integrity

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties_redesigned;
-- Should match old Properties table count

-- 2. Check properties with missing references
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties_redesigned 
WHERE property_type_id IS NULL OR property_status_id IS NULL;
-- Should be 0 or explained

-- 3. Check duplicate property numbers
SELECT property_number, COUNT(*) 
FROM properties_redesigned 
GROUP BY property_number 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Should return no results

-- 4. Check image associations
SELECT p.property_number, COUNT(i.id) as image_count
FROM properties_redesigned p
LEFT JOIN property_images i ON p.id = i.property_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.property_number
ORDER BY image_count DESC;

-- 5. Check facility associations
SELECT p.property_number, COUNT(uf.id) as facility_count
FROM properties_redesigned p
LEFT JOIN property_unit_facilities uf ON p.id = uf.property_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.property_number
ORDER BY facility_count DESC;
```

## ⚡ Performance Testing

### ✅ Query Performance
```javascript
// Test these query patterns

// 1. Basic property listing
console.time('Basic listing');
const basic = await getPropertiesWithDetails(50, 0);
console.timeEnd('Basic listing');
// Should be < 2 seconds

// 2. Filtered property search
console.time('Filtered search');
const filtered = await getPropertiesWithDetails(50, 0, {
    status: 'available',
    type: 'apartment',
    region: 'new_cairo',
    minPrice: 1000000,
    maxPrice: 5000000
});
console.timeEnd('Filtered search');
// Should be < 3 seconds

// 3. Single property with full details
console.time('Property details');
const property = await getPropertyById('property-id');
console.timeEnd('Property details');
// Should be < 1 second

// 4. Reference data loading
console.time('Reference data');
const options = await getFormOptionsForReact();
console.timeEnd('Reference data');
// Should be < 1 second
```
