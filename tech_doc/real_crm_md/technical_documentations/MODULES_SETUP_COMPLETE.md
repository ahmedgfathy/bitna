# ✅ CRM Modules and Profiles Setup Complete!

## 🔧 Issue Fixed: Missing Modules in Profile Management

### The Problem
You couldn't see any modules in the Profile Management system because the authentication system modules weren't initialized in the database.

### The Solution
I've created and run initialization scripts that:

1. **Created 4 Core Modules**:
   - **Leads Management** (6 permissions)
   - **Properties Management** (6 permissions) 
   - **Projects Management** (6 permissions)
   - **Administration** (7 permissions)

2. **Created 25 Detailed Permissions** with different access levels:
   - **Level 1**: View access
   - **Level 2**: Create/Export access
   - **Level 3**: Edit/Manage access
   - **Level 4**: Delete access
   - **Level 5**: System administration

3. **Set up Administrator Profile** with all permissions

## 🎯 Now You Can Create Custom Profiles!

### Access the Profile Management
1. **Login**: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (admin/admin123)
2. **Navigate**: Administration → Manage Profiles
3. **Create Profile**: Click "Create New Profile"
