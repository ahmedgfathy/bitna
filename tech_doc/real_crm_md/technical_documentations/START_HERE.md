# 🚀 START HERE - MCP Server Fix

## Your MCP server isn't working. Here's the fastest way to fix it.

---

## ⚡ QUICK FIX (Do This First!)

```bash
cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
chmod +x quick_fix.sh
./quick_fix.sh
```

Then:
1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely** (Cmd+Q)
2. **Reopen Claude Desktop**
3. **Look for 🔌 icon** - you should see "django-real-crm"

**Done!** That's all you need to do.

---

## 🎯 What's The Problem?

Your `.vscode/mcp.json` file is in the wrong location. It's for VS Code, not Claude Desktop.

**Claude Desktop needs its config here:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

The `quick_fix.sh` script creates this file for you automatically.

## ✅ How to Know It Worked

After running `quick_fix.sh` and restarting Claude Desktop:

1. **🔌 Icon appears** in Claude Desktop interface
2. **"django-real-crm"** listed when you click the icon  
3. **Status shows "Connected"** with green indicator
4. **6 tools available**: read_file, write_file, run_manage, db_query, list_project_files, get_project_info

Test it by asking Claude:
```
Can you use get_project_info() to show me my Django project information?
```

If Claude responds with project details, **it's working!** 🎉
