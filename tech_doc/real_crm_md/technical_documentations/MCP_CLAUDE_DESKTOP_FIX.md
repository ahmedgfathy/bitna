# üîß Claude Desktop MCP Server - FIXED!

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolved

The MCP server connection error in Claude Desktop has been fixed.

---

## üêõ The Problem

**Error Message:** `spawn python ENOENT`

**Root Causes:**
1. ‚ùå Config was using `"command": "python"` instead of full path to Python
2. ‚ùå Script path was wrong: `/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/mcp_server.py`
3. ‚ùå Correct path is: `/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/scripts/mcp_server.py`

**Log Evidence:**
```
2025-10-19T02:32:32.815Z [django-mcp] [error] spawn python ENOENT
Error: spawn python ENOENT
    at ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:285:19)
```

---

## ‚ú® The Solution

### 1. Updated Claude Desktop Config

**File Location:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Correct Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "django-mcp": {
      "command": "/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/scripts/mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE": "real_estate_crm.settings",
        "PYTHONPATH": "/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Key Changes Made

| Issue | Old Value | New Value |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Python Command** | `python` | `/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/venv/bin/python` |
| **Script Path** | `/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/mcp_server.py` | `/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/scripts/mcp_server.py` |
| **Environment** | Only `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | Added `PYTHONPATH` |
| **Transport** | Removed (unnecessary) | N/A |

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Claude Desktop

**Important:** You MUST restart Claude Desktop for the config changes to take effect.

1. Quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q)
2. Reopen Claude Desktop
3. Wait for it to initialize MCP servers

### Step 2: Verify Connection

Once Claude Desktop reopens, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No red error notifications
- ‚úÖ "django-mcp" server connected
- ‚úÖ MCP tools available in chat

### Step 3: Test the Connection

In Claude Desktop, try asking:
```
Can you check the Django project info using MCP?
```

Expected response will include:
- Project directory
- Python version (3.13.7)
- Django version (5.2.6)
- Database info (MariaDB)
- Installed apps list

---

## üîç Verify MCP Server is Working

### Check Logs

After restarting Claude Desktop, check the logs:

```bash
# View latest MCP log
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-django-mcp.log

# Should see success messages like:
# [info] Server started and connected successfully
# [info] Message from client: {"method":"initialize"...}
```

### Check Main Log

```bash
tail -20 ~/Library/Logs/Claude/main.log
```

Should NOT show:
- ‚ùå `spawn python ENOENT`
- ‚ùå `Server disconnected`

Should show:
- ‚úÖ `Server started and connected successfully`
- ‚úÖ `Using MCP server command: /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/venv/bin/python`

---

## üìã Available MCP Tools in Claude Desktop

Once connected, you'll have access to these Django-specific tools:

### 1. **read_file**
Read any project file
```
Example: Read the Property model
```

### 2. **write_file**
Create or update files
```
Example: Update a view or template
```

### 3. **list_project_files**
List directory contents
```
Example: List all templates in authentication app
```

### 4. **db_query**
Execute SQL queries on MariaDB
```
Example: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads_lead
```

### 5. **run_manage**
Run Django management commands
```
Example: showmigrations, check, etc.
```

### 6. **get_project_info**
Get full project information
```
Example: Show Django version, database config, installed apps
```

## üîí Security Notes

### Safe by Default

The MCP server includes security features:

1. **File Access:** Only within `/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/`
2. **SQL Safety:** Destructive queries require explicit permission
3. **Command Blocking:** Dangerous Django commands blocked
4. **Logging:** All operations logged to stderr

### Environment Variables

```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=real_estate_crm.settings
PYTHONPATH=/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
```

These ensure Django can find settings and import modules correctly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If MCP Still Doesn't Connect

1. **Check Python Path Exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/venv/bin/python
   ```
   Should show: `-rwxr-xr-x ... python`

2. **Check Script Path Exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/scripts/mcp_server.py
   ```
   Should show: `-rw-r--r-- ... mcp_server.py`

3. **Test Script Manually:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
   ./venv/bin/python scripts/mcp_server.py
   ```
   Should show MCP server startup messages

4. **Check Django Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
   ./venv/bin/python manage.py check
   ```
   Should show: `System check identified no issues`

5. **View Live Logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-django-mcp.log
   ```
   Then restart Claude Desktop and watch for errors

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution:** Make sure `PYTHONPATH` is set in env variables

#### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Solution:** Check MariaDB is running:
```bash
mysql -u root -p -h localhost django_db_real_crm
```

#### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Check script is readable:
```bash
chmod +x /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/scripts/mcp_server.py
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Restart Claude Desktop** - Most important!
2. ‚úÖ Test MCP connection by asking about project
3. ‚úÖ Try querying database: "How many leads are there?"
4. ‚úÖ Try reading a file: "Show me the Property model"
5. ‚úÖ Try running a command: "Run showmigrations"

---

## üí° Why This Happened

### The "python" Problem

Claude Desktop runs in a sandboxed environment and doesn't have access to your shell's PATH. When you specify `"command": "python"`, it can't find the Python executable because:

1. System Python might not be in its PATH
2. Virtual environment Python definitely isn't
3. macOS might not have a `python` command (only `python3`)

**Solution:** Always use **absolute paths** in MCP configs.

### The Path Problem

The initial config pointed to:
```
/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/mcp_server.py
```

But the file is actually at:
```
/Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/scripts/mcp_server.py
```

This happened because the file was moved to organize the project structure.

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After restarting Claude Desktop, confirm:

- [ ] No red error notifications
- [ ] MCP server "django-mcp" shows as connected
- [ ] Can ask Claude about Django project
- [ ] Can query database via Claude
- [ ] Can read project files via Claude
- [ ] Logs show successful connection
- [ ] No ENOENT errors in logs

2. ‚úÖ Fixed script path from `/mcp_server.py` to `/scripts/mcp_server.py`
3. ‚úÖ Added PYTHONPATH environment variable
4. ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary `transport` field

**Result:**
