## Visual Impact

### Before:
```
Arabic Sidebar:
العملاء المحتملون[666]  ← Too close, looks cramped

Navbar Search:
[🔍 | Search... | Ctrl+K]  ← Visible vertical lines
```

### After:
```
Arabic Sidebar:
العملاء المحتملون    [666]  ← Perfect spacing!

Navbar Search:
[🔍 Search... Ctrl+K]  ← Seamless, no lines
```

## Technical Details

### Badge Spacing Strategy
- Used `margin-left` in Arabic RTL (which appears on the right visually)
- Applied consistently across all components:
  - Sidebar navigation: 12px
  - List groups: 10px
  - Tabs and pills: 8px
  - General badges: 8px

### Input Group Border Strategy
- Removed individual borders from child elements
- Applied single border to parent container
- Result: Unified appearance without internal dividers

### Specificity Levels
All rules use `!important` to override Bootstrap defaults
Selector specificity: `html[lang="ar"] .component .element`
