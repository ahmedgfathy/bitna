# MCP Server Troubleshooting Summary

## 🎯 Quick Answer: Why Your MCP Server Isn't Working

### The Main Problem

Your `.vscode/mcp.json` file is in the **wrong location** for Claude Desktop. That file is for VS Code integration, not Claude Desktop.

**Claude Desktop needs its configuration here:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

---

## ⚡ The Fastest Fix

Run ONE command and follow the instructions:

```bash
cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm && chmod +x quick_fix.sh && ./quick_fix.sh
```

Then:
1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely** (Cmd+Q)
2. **Reopen Claude Desktop**
3. **Look for 🔌 icon** - you should see "django-real-crm"

**That's it!** The script fixes everything automatically.

---

## 📋 What Gets Fixed

The `quick_fix.sh` script automatically:

1. ✅ Creates/verifies Python virtual environment
2. ✅ Installs all required dependencies (fastmcp, mcp, django, mysql-connector)
3. ✅ Makes all scripts executable
4. ✅ Creates Claude Desktop configuration in the correct location
5. ✅ Tests that the server can start properly
6. ✅ Gives you clear next steps

---

## 🔍 Want to See What's Wrong First?

Run diagnostics to see exactly what needs fixing:

```bash
cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
chmod +x diagnose_mcp.sh
./diagnose_mcp.sh
```

This runs 19 tests and shows you:
- ✅ What's working
- ❌ What's broken
- 💡 How to fix each issue

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### In Terminal (when testing manually):
```
============================================================
🚀 MCP Server for Django + MariaDB
============================================================
📁 Project Directory: /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
🗄️  Database: django_db_real_crm@localhost:3306
🔌 Transport: stdio (for AI agent communication)
============================================================
✅ Available Tools:
  • read_file(path)
  • write_file(path, content)
  • run_manage(command)
  • db_query(sql, allow_modify=False)
  • list_project_files(directory)
  • get_project_info()
```

### In Claude Desktop:
- 🔌 Hammer/tools icon appears in the interface
- "django-real-crm" listed as available server
- Status shows "Connected" (green indicator)
- 6 tools available to use

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **❌ DON'T** just close Claude Desktop - you must **completely quit** (Cmd+Q)
2. **❌ DON'T** edit `.vscode/mcp.json` - that's for VS Code, not Claude Desktop
3. **❌ DON'T** forget to make scripts executable first (`chmod +x`)
4. **❌ DON'T** skip restarting Claude Desktop after configuration changes

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

After running `quick_fix.sh`:

- [ ] Script completed without errors
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] Config file created at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- [ ] Claude Desktop completely restarted (Cmd+Q then reopen)
- [ ] 🔌 icon visible in Claude Desktop
- [ ] "django-real-crm" server appears in list
- [ ] Server shows as "Connected"
- [ ] Can ask Claude to use tools successfully

## 🧪 Test Commands for Claude Desktop

Once connected, try asking Claude:

1. **Get project info**:
   ```
   Use get_project_info() to show me my Django project details
   ```

2. **List files**:
   ```
   Use list_project_files('.') to show me what's in my project root
   ```

3. **Check database**:
   ```
   Run db_query('SHOW TABLES;') to list all database tables
   ```

4. **Read a file**:
   ```
   Use read_file('manage.py') to show me the Django management script
   ```

---

## 🆘 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Step 1: Run Full Diagnostics
```bash
cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
./diagnose_mcp.sh
```

### Step 2: Check What Failed
Look at the diagnostic output and fix failed tests

### Step 3: View Claude Desktop Logs
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Menu: Help → View Logs
3. Look for MCP-related errors

### Step 4: Clean Install
```bash
cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm
rm -rf venv
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
./quick_fix.sh
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why It Wasn't Working

1. **Wrong Config Location**: `.vscode/mcp.json` is for VS Code, not Claude Desktop
2. **Different Format**: Claude Desktop expects config in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`
3. **Missing Dependencies**: May not have had fastmcp/mcp installed
4. **Not Restarted**: Claude Desktop needs complete restart after config changes

### How It Works Now

```
Claude Desktop reads:
  ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
  
Which tells it to run:
  /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/venv/bin/python
  /Users/ahmedgomaa/Downloads/real_crm/mcp_server.py
  
Which provides 6 tools:
  read_file, write_file, run_manage, db_query,
  list_project_files, get_project_info
  
Which connect to:
  Your Django project files + MariaDB database
```
