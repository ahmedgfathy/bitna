# NextCRM (minimal Next.js scaffold)

This is a minimal Next.js app scaffold (App Router) created inside the `nextcrm` folder.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Run development server:

   npm run dev

3. Build for production (creates the `.next` folder):

   npm run build

4. Start production server after build:

   npm start

Verification / notes

- This scaffold uses the App Router (`app/`) introduced in Next.js. The entry is `app/layout.jsx` and `app/page.jsx`.
- After `npm run build` you should see a `.next` folder with server and static build outputs. I ran the build in this workspace and it completed successfully.
- If you want TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, or authentication (NextAuth), I can add them next.
