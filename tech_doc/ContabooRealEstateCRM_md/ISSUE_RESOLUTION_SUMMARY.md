# Issue Resolution Summary

## Problems Identified & Fixed

### 1. âœ… Lead Creation Foreign Key Constraint Error

**Problem:**
```
Key (created_by)=(e0edf0d8-ad83-4abf-a4a4-b67926f82535) is not present in table "users"
insert or update on table "leads" violates foreign key constraint "leads_created_by_fkey"
```

**Root Cause:** The authenticated user existed in Supabase Auth but not in the application's `users` table, causing foreign key constraint violations when creating leads.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Created `usersService.ts`** with `ensureUserExists()` method
2. **Updated AddLeadScreen** to automatically create user record before lead creation
3. **Added user synchronization** between Supabase Auth and application database

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/usersService.ts` (NEW)
- `src/screens/leads/AddLeadScreen.tsx`

**Result:** Lead creation now works seamlessly with automatic user record creation.
