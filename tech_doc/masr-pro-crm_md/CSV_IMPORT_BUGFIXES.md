# CSV Import - Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Column Mapping Dropdowns Not Showing
**Problem**: The Select dropdowns for mapping CSV columns to database fields were not rendering properly.

**Solution**: 
- Changed dialog layout from `ScrollArea` to direct `overflow-y-auto` on inner div
- Added better styling with `bg-background` to each mapping row
- Added `SelectValue placeholder` to ensure the select shows properly
- Made layout responsive with `flex-col sm:flex-row`

### 2. ✅ Import Button Not Working / Loading Errors
**Problem**: Clicking import would fail with errors.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added comprehensive validation for required fields
- Added better error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added row-by-row validation (skips rows with missing required data)
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Improved error messages with specific field names
- Added `canImport` check that validates all required fields are mapped before enabling import button

### 3. ✅ Required Fields Indication
**Problem**: Users couldn't easily see which fields were required.

**Solution**:
- Added ⭐ star emoji next to required fields (Full Name, Phone, City)
- Added Alert box below mapping section highlighting required fields
- Import button now disabled until all required fields are mapped

### 4. ✅ Better Auto-Detection
**Problem**: Auto-detection wasn't catching all common column name variations.

**Solution**: Enhanced auto-detection to recognize:
- "Tel" → Phone
- "Mail" → Email  
- "Address" → City
- "Last Name" → Skip (since we only have full_name field)
- Better keyword matching

### 5. ✅ Template Input Not Visible
**Problem**: Template name input box wasn't clearly visible.

**Solution**:
- Added Label for "Save Current Mapping"
- Better placeholder text
- Only shows template selector if templates exist
- Improved spacing and layout

## New Features Added

### Visual Improvements
- Each mapping row now has a light background (`bg-background`)
- Contained within a scrollable area (max 300px height)
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Arrow (→) between CSV column and mapping dropdown

### Validation
- Import button disabled until all required fields mapped
- Row-level validation (skips invalid rows instead of failing entire import)
- Better error messages showing which fields are missing

### Debugging
- Console logs for CSV parsing
- Console logs for auto-detected mappings
- Per-row error logging with row numbers
- Detailed error messages in toasts

## How to Test

1. **Upload the sample CSV file** (`sample_leads.csv` in project root)
   - Should see: "10 columns detected, 9 rows to import"
   - Check browser console for detected headers and mappings

2. **Check Auto-Mapping**
   - All columns should auto-map correctly
   - "Name" → Full Name ⭐
   - "Phone" → Phone ⭐
   - "City" → City ⭐
   - Others mapped appropriately

3. **Test Dropdown Selection**
   - Each CSV column should have a dropdown
   - Dropdown should show all field options
   - Required fields marked with ⭐
   - Can change any mapping manually

4. **Test Import Button States**
   - Should be DISABLED if required fields not mapped
   - Should be ENABLED when Full Name, Phone, City are all mapped
   - Should show "Importing..." during import
   - Should show "Import 9 Leads" when ready

5. **Test Import Process**
   - Click Import
   - Should see success toast
   - Check Leads page - new leads should appear
   - Check browser console for any errors

6. **Test Template Save/Load**
   - Map columns
   - Enter template name: "Test Template"
   - Click "Save Template"
   - Close dialog
   - Reopen import dialog
   - Select "Test Template" from dropdown
   - All mappings should restore

## If Still Having Issues

### Check Browser Console
Press F12 and look for:
- "CSV Headers detected:" - Shows detected columns
- "Auto-detected mapping:" - Shows auto-mapping results
- Any red error messages

### Common Issues

**Import fails with "Missing required fields"**
- Make sure Full Name, Phone, and City dropdowns are NOT set to "Skip"
- Check that CSV actually has data in those columns

**Dropdowns still not showing**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Check if shadcn Select component is installed: `npx shadcn@latest add select`

**Template save fails**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check Supabase dashboard - verify `import_mapping_templates` table exists
- Run the migration SQL from `supabase/migrations/20251013020000_import_mapping_templates.sql`

**Import creates empty leads**
- Check that CSV data columns align with headers
- Verify no extra commas in CSV
- Check for proper quote escaping

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/components/leads/ImportLeadsDialog.tsx` - Main fixes
- ✅ Better layout and styling
- ✅ Enhanced validation
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

## Next Steps

Once confirmed working:
1. Test with your real Leads.csv file (1724 rows)
2. Save a template for that specific CSV format
3. Future imports will be much faster using the template
4. Check imported data in Leads page

## Migration Reminder

⚠️ **Don't forget to apply the database migration!**

Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run this:
```sql
-- Paste contents of:
-- /supabase/migrations/20251013020000_import_mapping_templates.sql
```

Without this, template save/load won't work (but import will still work).
