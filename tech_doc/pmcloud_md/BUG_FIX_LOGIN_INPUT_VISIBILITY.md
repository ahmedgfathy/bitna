# Bug Fix: Login Page Input Text Not Visible

## Issue Description
On the login page, when users type in the email and password fields, the text they type is invisible/not showing up. The placeholder text is visible, but the actual input text is the same color as the background.

## Root Cause
The input fields were missing explicit text color classes in Tailwind CSS. When text is typed, it was defaulting to a color that blended with the light background.

## Solution Applied

### Changed Input Fields
Added explicit text color and placeholder color classes to both email and password input fields:

**Before:**
```tsx
className="w-full px-4 py-3 bg-white/50 backdrop-blur-sm border border-gray-200 rounded-xl focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-transparent transition-all duration-200 group-hover:bg-white/70"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="w-full px-4 py-3 bg-white/50 backdrop-blur-sm border border-gray-200 rounded-xl focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-transparent transition-all duration-200 group-hover:bg-white/70 text-gray-900 placeholder-gray-400"
```

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ Added `text-gray-900` - Makes typed text dark and visible
2. ✅ Added `placeholder-gray-400` - Makes placeholder text lighter gray
3. ✅ Added `pointer-events-none` to icon containers - Prevents icons from blocking input
4. ✅ Updated placeholders to be more representative:
   - Email: `xinreal@pms.eg` (example format)
   - Password: `••••••••` (password dots)

## Files Modified
- `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Fixed input field styling

## Testing
After this fix:
- ✅ Typed text in email field is now visible (dark gray)
- ✅ Typed text in password field is now visible (dark gray)
- ✅ Placeholder text is lighter gray for better contrast
- ✅ Icons don't interfere with typing
- ✅ Focus states work correctly
- ✅ Hover effects still work

## Related Issues Fixed
- Fixed ESLint warning about apostrophe in "Don't" → Changed to "Don&apos;t"
- Added error logging for better debugging

## Before & After

### Before:
```
Email input: [           ] ← Text invisible when typing
Password input: [           ] ← Text invisible when typing
```

### After:
```
Email input: [xinreal@pms.eg] ← Text clearly visible
Password input: [••••••••] ← Text clearly visible
```
