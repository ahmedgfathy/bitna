```sql
SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, 
       COUNT(*) as total_actions,
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
FROM "AuditLog" 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### **Most Active Users This Month**
```sql
SELECT u.name, u.role, COUNT(*) as action_count
FROM "AuditLog" al
JOIN "User" u ON al.user_id = u.id
WHERE al.created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.role
ORDER BY action_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### **Failed Operations Requiring Attention**
```sql
SELECT action, table_name, COUNT(*) as failure_count,
       array_agg(DISTINCT u.name) as users
FROM "AuditLog" al
LEFT JOIN "User" u ON al.user_id = u.id
WHERE success = false
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
