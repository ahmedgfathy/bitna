# Phase 1: Foundation & Role System

## üéØ **Objectives**
1. Fix current action buttons (View, Edit, Delete leads)
2. Implement comprehensive role-based user system
3. Create user management interface
4. Set up basic permission framework

## üîß **Current Issues to Fix**

### **1. Lead Action Buttons**
- **View Button**: Not opening lead details modal
- **Edit Button**: Not opening edit form
- **Delete Button**: Not showing confirmation dialog
- **Add Lead**: May have form validation issues

### **2. Authentication Flow**
- First user registration should automatically become **Owner**
- Subsequent registrations need approval workflow
- Role assignment during user creation

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema Updates**

### **New Tables to Create:**

#### **1. Roles Table**
```sql
roles {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  name: String (Owner, Manager, TeamLeader, Employee)
  description: String
  level: Int (1=Owner, 2=Manager, 3=TeamLeader, 4=Employee)
  permissions: Json (Array of permission strings)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

#### **2. Departments Table**
```sql
departments {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  name: String (Sales, Marketing, Support, etc.)
  description: String
  managerId: String (Foreign Key to User)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

#### **3. Teams Table**
```sql
teams {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  name: String
  departmentId: String (Foreign Key to Department)
  leaderId: String (Foreign Key to User)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

#### **4. Updated User Table**
```sql
users {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  email: String (Unique)
  name: String
  password: String
  roleId: String (Foreign Key to Role)
  departmentId: String? (Foreign Key to Department)
  teamId: String? (Foreign Key to Team)
  managerId: String? (Foreign Key to User - their direct manager)
  isActive: Boolean (Default: false - needs approval)
  isFirstUser: Boolean (Default: false - first user becomes owner)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

## üé≠ **Role Definitions**

### **1. Owner (Level 1)**
- **Description**: Company owner/founder with full system access
- **Permissions**: ALL (Full CRUD on everything)

| Owner | ALL | ALL | ALL | ALL | ALL |
| Manager | Department | Team Only | Department | Limited | Department |
| Team Leader | Team Only | Team Only | Team Only | None | Team Only |
