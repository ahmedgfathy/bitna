# App Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add the following icon files to the `/public/icons/` directory:

## Required Icon Sizes:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png  
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

## Quick Icon Generation:
You can generate these icons from a single high-resolution logo using:
1. **Online Tools:** https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. **Command Line:** Using ImageMagick or similar tools

## Temporary Placeholder:
For now, you can use any square PNG images with the above sizes, or generate them from your WhatsTeX logo.

The icons should represent your app with a clean, professional design that works well on mobile home screens.
