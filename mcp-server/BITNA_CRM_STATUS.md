## ‚ùå The Windows-MCP Issue (Separate Problem)

The error you see in Claude Desktop is from **Windows-MCP**, NOT from bitna-crm:

### Windows-MCP Error
```
'uv' is not recognized as an internal or external command
spawn uv ENOENT
```

This is a **VS Code extension MCP server** that's trying to run but:
- Looking for `uv` (Python package manager) which isn't installed
- This is NOT your bitna-crm server
- This doesn't affect your bitna-crm functionality

## üéØ Your bitna-crm Server is Already Working!

You can now use Claude Desktop to query your CRM database with commands like:

### Example Queries You Can Try

1. **"Show me properties from my database"**
   - Will call `get_properties` tool

2. **"How many properties do I have?"**
   - Will call `get_stats` tool

3. **"List recent leads"**
   - Will call `get_leads` tool

4. **"What property types are available?"**
   - Will call `get_static_data` tool with type="property_types"

5. **"Give me CRM statistics"**
   - Will call `get_stats` tool

## üîß Fixing the Windows-MCP Error (Optional)

If you want to remove the error notification:

### Option 1: Disable in VS Code (Recommended)
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions
3. Find "Windows MCP" or similar extension
4. Disable or uninstall it

### Option 2: Install UV (If You Need Windows-MCP)
```powershell
# In PowerShell
pip install uv
```

### Option 3: Ignore It
- The Windows-MCP error doesn't affect bitna-crm
- You can just dismiss the error notification
- Your bitna-crm server works independently

## üìä Connection Summary

| Server | Status | Tools | Database | Issue |
|--------|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| **bitna-crm** | ‚úÖ Connected | 6 tools | contaboo (12,398 props) | None |
| Windows-MCP | ‚ùå Disconnected | N/A | N/A | Missing 'uv' command |

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Your bitna-crm is working - no action needed!
2. ‚è≥ Try asking Claude about your CRM data
3. üîß (Optional) Disable Windows-MCP extension in VS Code to remove error

## Test It Now!

In Claude Desktop, try asking:
```
"Can you show me 5 properties from my database?"
```

Claude will use the `get_properties` tool from your bitna-crm server and return real data from your contaboo database!

**Your MCP server is working! The error is from a different, unrelated server.** üéâ
