  ...(isOwner || isManager ? [{ id: 'team', label: 'Team Management', icon: '👥' }] : []),
  { id: 'preferences', label: 'Preferences', icon: '⚙️' },
];
```

## Technical Implementation

### File Modified
`/mobile/src/screens/dashboard/SettingsScreen.tsx`

### Key Changes
1. **Added tab state management:**
   ```typescript
   type TabType = 'account' | 'company' | 'team' | 'preferences';
   const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<TabType>('account');
   ```

2. **Created dynamic tab array with role-based visibility:**
   ```typescript
   const tabs = [
     { id: 'account' as TabType, label: t('accountSettings'), icon: '👤' },
     ...(canManageCompany ? [{ id: 'company' as TabType, label: t('companyProfile'), icon: '🏢' }] : []),
     ...(canManageEmployees ? [{ id: 'team' as TabType, label: t('teamManagement'), icon: '👥' }] : []),
     { id: 'preferences' as TabType, label: t('preferences'), icon: '⚙️' },
   ];
   ```

3. **Implemented tab content renderer:**
   ```typescript
   const renderTabContent = () => {
     switch (activeTab) {
       case 'account': return <AccountContent />;
       case 'company': return <CompanyProfileCard />;
       case 'team': return <EmployeeManagement />;
       case 'preferences': return <PreferencesContent />;
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Built responsive tab bar UI:**
