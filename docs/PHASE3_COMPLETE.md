## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### How to Test on Your Phone

1. **Ensure Expo is running:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ahmedgomaa/bitna/mobile
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go app

3. **Test the flow:**
   - ✅ See 4 property cards on homepage
   - ✅ Scroll through property list
   - ✅ Pull to refresh (properties reload)
   - ✅ Click a property → see full details
   - ✅ Click "Login" in header → see login screen
   - ✅ Enter phone number → button enables at 10 digits
   - ✅ Click "Join" in header → see subscription options
   - ✅ Select Freelancer or Company → button enables
   - ✅ Navigate back using header back button

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Login/Subscribe buttons show alerts (Phase 4 placeholder)
   - Search bar is non-functional (future feature)
   - "Find Near Me" is disabled with "Coming Soon" badge
   - All navigation transitions are smooth

---

## 🚧 Placeholder Functionality

The following features are **UI-only** and will be implemented in Phase 4:

- ❌ **OTP Authentication** - Login screen collects phone but doesn't send OTP
- ❌ **Registration Flow** - Subscribe screen collects type but doesn't create account
- ❌ **API Integration** - Properties are mock data, not from backend
- ❌ **Search Functionality** - Search bar is visual only
- ❌ **Location Services** - "Find Near Me" not functional
- ❌ **Token Management** - No JWT handling yet
- ❌ **State Persistence** - No user session storage

---

## 🔗 API Integration Notes (For Phase 4)

### HomeScreen - Properties API
Replace mock data with:
```typescript
const response = await api.get('/properties/public');
setProperties(response.data);
```

Expected endpoint: `GET /api/properties/public`  
Returns: Array of PropertyType objects with `isPublic: true`

### PropertyDetailsScreen - Single Property API
```typescript
const response = await api.get(`/properties/${propertyId}`);
setProperty(response.data);
```

Expected endpoint: `GET /api/properties/:id`  
Returns: Single PropertyType object

---

## 📈 Next Steps - Phase 4

### Authentication & OTP Flow

**Login Flow:**
1. User enters phone number → validate format
2. Send OTP via SMS API (Twilio/similar)
3. User enters OTP code
4. Verify OTP with backend
5. Receive JWT token
6. Store token in AsyncStorage
7. Navigate to authenticated dashboard

**Registration Flow:**
1. User selects Freelancer/Company
2. Enter phone number
3. Send OTP
4. Verify OTP
5. Collect additional info:
   - Name
   - Company name (if company type)
   - Email (optional)
6. Create tenant + user in backend
7. Receive JWT token
8. Store token and navigate

**Backend Requirements:**
- `POST /api/auth/send-otp` - Send OTP code
- `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - Verify code & return token
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create new tenant + user
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user (with token)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **TypeScript Import Errors:** Metro bundler may show temporary import errors for screen files until it reloads. These resolve automatically when Expo restarts.
- **Image Loading:** Unsplash URLs require internet connection. May show placeholder gray box on slow connections.
- **No Error Handling:** Mock data always succeeds. Real API calls will need try-catch blocks.
